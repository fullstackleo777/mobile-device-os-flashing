# Remove Android and Install Linux on Galaxy Tab S6

## Galaxy Tab S6 (SM-T867U)

Changing the operating system on your Galaxy Tab S6 (SM-T867U) from Android to Linux involves a few technical steps, including unlocking the bootloader, installing a custom recovery, and then flashing a Linux-based OS. Here's a high-level guide to help you through the process:

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **Backup your data**: This process will wipe all data from your device, so ensure you have a full backup.
- **Unlock bootloader**: Unlocking the bootloader is necessary to flash custom ROMs or operating systems. Note that this may void your warranty and can cause issues if done incorrectly.
- **Install drivers**: Ensure you have Samsung USB drivers installed on your PC.
- **ADB and Fastboot**: Install ADB and Fastboot on your computer. This will allow you to communicate with the tablet from your PC.
- **Custom recovery**: You will need a custom recovery like TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project) to install a new OS.

### **2. Unlock the Bootloader**
1. **Enable Developer Mode**:
   - Go to `Settings` > `About tablet` > `Software Information` and tap "Build number" 7 times until it says Developer Mode is enabled.
   
2. **Enable OEM Unlocking**:
   - Go to `Settings` > `Developer options` and toggle on "OEM unlocking."

3. **Enter Download Mode**:
   - Turn off the tablet.
   - Press and hold the `Volume Up + Volume Down` buttons simultaneously and connect the tablet to a PC via USB.
   
4. **Unlock the Bootloader**:
   - In Download Mode, you’ll be prompted to confirm unlocking the bootloader. Follow the on-screen instructions.
   - The tablet will reboot and perform a factory reset.

1. **Download TWRP**: Visit the [TWRP website](https://twrp.me/) and download the version for your Galaxy Tab S6.
   
2. **Flash TWRP via Odin**:
   - Put the tablet back in Download Mode (as described above).
   - Open Odin on your PC (download it from the official site if you don't have it).
   - In Odin, click on the `AP` button and select the TWRP `.tar` file you downloaded.
   - Click `Start` in Odin to flash TWRP.
   
3. **Reboot to Recovery**:
   - After the installation, press and hold `Power + Volume Down` to exit Download Mode, and immediately press `Power + Volume Up` to boot into TWRP Recovery.

### **4. Flash a Linux-based OS**
Now you can install a Linux-based OS, such as Ubuntu Touch, postmarketOS, or a similar custom OS for tablets.

1. **Download a Linux OS image** compatible with your tablet (e.g., Ubuntu Touch or postmarketOS).
2. **Transfer the OS image** to your tablet using a USB or an SD card.
3. **Install via TWRP**:
   - In TWRP, go to `Wipe` > `Advanced Wipe` and wipe the system, cache, and data partitions.
   - Go to `Install`, select the Linux OS image, and swipe to confirm the installation.
   
4. **Reboot**:
   - After the installation is complete, go back to the main TWRP menu and select `Reboot System`.

### **5. Set Up Your Linux OS**
Once the tablet reboots, you’ll need to go through the setup process for the Linux-based OS you've chosen. The interface and steps may vary depending on the OS.

### **Important Considerations**:
- **Compatibility**: Not all Linux distributions support your tablet model. Research and verify if the distribution works well on the Galaxy Tab S6.
