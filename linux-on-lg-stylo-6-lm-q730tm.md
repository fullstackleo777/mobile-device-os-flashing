Changing the operating system (OS) on your **LG Stylo 6 LM-Q730TM** from Android to a Linux-based OS is a challenging and experimental process that involves several technical steps. This process will completely replace the Android OS with a Linux distribution designed for smartphones, such as **PostmarketOS**, **Ubuntu Touch**, or other similar Linux-based operating systems.

Before proceeding, there are several important considerations and risks to keep in mind:

### **Key Considerations:**
1. **Warranty Void**: Unlocking the bootloader and flashing custom ROMs will void the warranty of your device.
2. **Potential for Bricking**: If the flashing process is not done correctly, it can render your device unusable (bricked).
3. **Data Loss**: The process will wipe all data on your phone, so be sure to back up everything you need.
4. **Hardware Compatibility**: Not all features (camera, sensors, touchscreen, etc.) may work out of the box, and you might need to install or configure drivers manually.
5. **Stability Issues**: Linux mobile OSes are generally in a beta or development phase for many devices, so there may be instability, bugs, and performance issues.

With that said, if you still want to proceed, here is a step-by-step guide to replacing Android with Linux on your LG Stylo 6 LM-Q730TM.

### **Step-by-Step Process**

#### **1. Unlock the Bootloader**
Before installing a new OS, you need to unlock the bootloader of your LG Stylo 6. This will allow you to flash custom ROMs.

##### Steps to unlock the bootloader:
1. **Enable Developer Options**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **About phone** → Tap **Build number** 7 times to enable Developer Options.

2. **Enable OEM Unlocking**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Developer options** → Enable **OEM Unlocking**.

3. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - In **Developer options**, enable **USB Debugging**.

4. **Install ADB and Fastboot on Your PC**:
   - On Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install adb fastboot
     ```
   - On Windows, download and install the [ADB tool](https://developer.android.com/studio) or use an installer like [Minimal ADB and Fastboot](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790).

5. **Connect the Device to Your Computer**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect your LG Stylo 6 to the computer.

6. **Check if ADB Recognizes Your Device**:
   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

   If the device appears, you can proceed. Otherwise, troubleshoot your connection.

7. **Reboot the Device into Bootloader Mode**:
   ```bash
   adb reboot bootloader
   ```

8. **Unlock the Bootloader** (Note: This will wipe your data!):
   ```bash
   fastboot oem unlock
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions on your device to confirm. This may take a few minutes.

9. **Reboot the Phone**:
   After unlocking the bootloader, your phone will reboot, and it will be wiped clean.

#### **2. Install a Custom Recovery (TWRP)**

To flash a Linux-based OS, you need a custom recovery like **TWRP**. This is necessary for installing the new OS.

1. **Download TWRP for LG Stylo 6**:
   - Search for the appropriate TWRP image for your LG Stylo 6 model on [XDA Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/).
   - The TWRP image will typically be in `.img` format.

2. **Flash TWRP via Fastboot**:
   - Once the TWRP image is downloaded, use `fastboot` to flash it to your device:
     ```bash
     fastboot flash recovery twrp.img
     ```

3. **Reboot into TWRP**:
   - To boot into TWRP recovery, you can either use:
     ```bash
     fastboot boot twrp.img
     ```
   - Or manually use the hardware buttons to boot into recovery mode.

#### **3. Download and Prepare a Linux OS Image**

You now need to download a Linux distribution for ARM architecture that is compatible with mobile devices. The most popular options are **PostmarketOS**, **Ubuntu Touch**, and **Sailfish OS**. We'll use **PostmarketOS** as the main example here.

1. **PostmarketOS** is designed for mobile devices and is one of the best Linux distros for phones.
   - Visit the [PostmarketOS download page](https://postmarketos.org) and check if your device is supported.
   - If there isn't a prebuilt image for the LG Stylo 6, you will either have to wait for one or attempt to port it yourself (which is quite complex and requires knowledge of Linux and device drivers).

2. **Download the PostmarketOS Image**:
   - If a prebuilt image is available, download it to your computer.
   - Alternatively, you can build PostmarketOS from source, but this is a much more complicated process and is recommended for advanced users only.

---

#### **4. Flash the Linux OS**

1. **Transfer the PostmarketOS Image to Your Device**:
   - Use ADB to transfer the image to your device's storage:
     ```bash
     adb push postmarketos.img /sdcard/
     ```

2. **Wipe the Device**:
   - In **TWRP**, go to **Wipe** → **Advanced Wipe**.
   - Select **Dalvik/ART Cache**, **System**, **Data**, and **Cache** to wipe the device clean.

3. **Flash the Linux OS**:
   - In TWRP, go to **Install** and select the PostmarketOS image you transferred.
   - Confirm the flash and wait for the process to complete.

4. **Reboot into Linux**:
   - Once the installation is complete, reboot your device into the new Linux OS.

#### **5. Post-Installation Setup**

- **Initial Boot**:
   The first boot into the new OS might take a while. Be patient and let it fully boot up.

- **Configure System Settings**:
   - You may need to set up basic things like Wi-Fi, user preferences, and other configuration options.

- **Test Hardware Compatibility**:
   - Check if all features like touchscreen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc., are working. If not, you may need to install additional drivers or adjust configurations.

### **Challenges and Considerations**

- **Device-Specific Drivers**: Not all devices have full support in Linux-based mobile OSes. The LG Stylo 6 may not have all hardware supported (e.g., camera, fingerprint sensor, and GPS might not work out of the box).
- **Performance Issues**: Mobile Linux OSes are still in development, and not all features of Android may be replicated. Expect some instability or performance issues.
- **No Easy Recovery**: If something goes wrong, recovery can be more difficult. You may need to reflash Android or a stock ROM to restore functionality.

---

### **Alternative Linux Distributions**
- **Ubuntu Touch**: A more polished, user-friendly option.
- **Sailfish OS**: Linux-based with some Android compatibility (but not as widely supported on non-Purism devices).
- **LineageOS**: Though not Linux-based, it is an alternative custom ROM if you're looking for something different from stock Android.
